easing
======

Easing functions simply describe functions that are used for the purpose of easing.
You can find many libraries that give you easing functionality, but you're usually tied to a large library and
that means a large intrusion of unwanted code, similar to installing an application and it asking if you'd like the Bing Bar, Yahoo Search, 
and free Email Weather Reports with a promise to never sell your information unless the price is right.

This library just gives you the MATH.

Give it an array of arbitrary size and it fills those values. You'll be animating and looking stylish in no time.

Load it up
==========
    
    Simply include browser-easing.js and you can require('easing') directly in your client side code.


Simple
======

    var x = Easing(11,'cubic');


    And there you have it, an array of eleven elements whose value starts at 0 and ends at 1 which are populated with
    cubic easing values.

    [ 0,
        0.0010000000000000002,
        0.008000000000000002,
        0.02700000000000001,
        0.06400000000000002,
        0.125,
        0.21600000000000008,
        0.3430000000000001,
        0.5120000000000001,
        0.7290000000000001,
    1 ]


Types of Easing
===============

Linear
------

For an array of 42 values that are linear, 

    Easing(42,'linear')

 
Quadratic
---------

For an array of 100 values that are quadratic,

    Easing(100,'quadratic')

 
Cubic
-----

For an array of 42 cubic values,
    
    Easing(42,'cubic')

Quartic
-------

For an array of 1492 quartic values,

    Easing(1492,'quartic')

Quintic
-------

    Easing(25,'quintic')


Sinusoidal
----------
    
    Easing(333,'sinusoidal')
    Easing(333,'sin')

Circular
--------
    
    Easing(314,'circular')


Exponential
-----------
    
    Easing(81,'exponential')



Optional options
================

End To End
----------

If we wanted to go from 0 to 1 back to 0 quadratically, simply call 

    Easing(100,'quadratic',{endToEnd:true});

Invert
------

If we want to go from 1 to 0 (or 1 to 0 back to 1) instead of 0 to 1, say 'linear' style, simply call 

    Easing(100,'linear',{invert:true});

You can mix and match these options.
